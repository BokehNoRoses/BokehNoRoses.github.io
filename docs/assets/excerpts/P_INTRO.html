<h2><span class="type" style="--n:1174; --time: 0.002s;">I am United States Army Reservist with a background as a Logistics Management Specialist, specifically for providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) defense capabilities. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science, in which I was a Junior Data Scientist with a Microsoft Gold Partner for a short stint after university. My handle is based on a <span class="inline-code">python</span> package called <span class="inline-code">bokeh</span> that I used for fun doing geographical data visualations. In the 10 years I've started using computers for programming and IT work, I've developed a fervent passion for the industry as an intersection between arts and science, starting with my first forays into programming using <span class="inline-code">freecodecamp.org</span> and creating my step-father's website using PHP to setting up A/V for teleconferences at the enterprise level. I aspire to make a career out of being a systems administrator that can truly leverage the experiences I had during military service as well as personal pursuits to become a benefit and credit to a worthwhile organization or cause.</span></h2>

<h2 class="type" style="--n:20;">My hobbies include:</h2>
<div class="type" style="--n:274;">
	<ul>
		<li><h2 style="text-decoration: underline var(--subtext0); margin: 10px 0;">Music Production:</h2><h2>I have played musical instruments from a young age, starting with recorder to viola to trumpet and even drums and guitar, but I had a long hiatus during my teenage years. In Senior year of university, I picked up my first Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), FL Studio, and I haven't looked back since. I currently use Bitwig Studios to compose flavors of Drum n' Bass, Orchestral, and Electronic music, but I listen to most genres of music. One day, I hope to make an EP I am really proud of.</h2></li>
		<li><h2 style="text-decoration: underline var(--subtext0); margin: 10px 0;">Martial Arts:</h2><h2>I've also done many sports growing up, but my first real experience with a single-competitor contact sport was wrestling in high school. I cannot wrap my head around many of the higher level techniques, but it's extremely satisfying to perform mental gymnastics while under duress to submit an opponent. I have since done MMA, Jiu Jitsu, and Muay Thai (in that order).</h2></li>
		<li><h2 style="text-decoration: underline var(--subtext0); margin: 10px 0;">Home Lab:</h2><h2>Wouldn't be a techie if you didn't home lab, right? This more or less an extension of my music production hobby as I like to set up media servers for my in-home entertainment theater experience, but I like to try emerging technologies that pique my interest. Taking look at my useful scripts tab, you will see I'll have a lot of items related to working with PipeWire, ALSA, PulseAudio, FFMpeg, and other media related tasks.</h2></li>
		<li><h2 style="text-decoration: underline var(--subtext0); margin: 10px 0;">Website Programming:</h2><h2>(Hence why I have opted for the hard way with hundred lines of spaghetti code :)). I love how accessible coding a webpage in vanilla <span class="inline-code">html</span>, <span class="inline-code">css</span>, and <span class="inline-code">js</span> is, but I wanted to challenge myself a little and do some re-writes in Rust. I am absolutely infatuated with the Rust programming language and I hope to learn more as I can continue to make new projects.</h2></li>
